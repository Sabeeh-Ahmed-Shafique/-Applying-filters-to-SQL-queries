# Project Overview
Recently some potential security issues were discovered at the organization that involve login attempts and employee machines. I examined the organizationâ€™s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables by using different SQL filters, retrieved records from datasets and investigated the potential security issues.

I performed the following tasks using SQL filters:

- Retrieve after hours failed login attempts.

- Retrieve login attempts on specific dates.

### Summary
I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables, log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND,
OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.
